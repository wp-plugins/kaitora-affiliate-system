== Description ==

The Kaitora Affiliate system is a plugin that finds and replaces user specified keywords, and masks the URL with what appears to be an internal link. The plugin will then process the link and forward the user to the user specified link. The plugin also counts how many clicks each keyword has recieved, and can be viewed in the admin panel.

Users have the options of adding keywords, the URL they redirect to, how often to replace instances of this keyword, and the ability to limit a maximum number of all keywords replaced.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Some keywords break the keywords links, what do I do?

These keywords are generally used within your URL, so if you MUST use this system for them, ensure they are the first keywords you add to the plugin, alternatively, use something such as PHPMyAdmin to change the ID's of each keyword in the table, and make this keyword 0, so it is the first replaced.
